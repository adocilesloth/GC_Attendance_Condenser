Global Conflict Attendance Condenser

Designed to be run if Global Conflict Teamspeak3 Attendance Generator crashes while it is running. It will preform the clean up on Client.txt that won't otherwise be run.

It generates one .txt doc:
	AttendanceRecovery-yyyy-mm-dd.txt
		Has the sorted list of all clients in the tree when the program runs. Each client (should) only appear once. It takes into account suffixes for number of rounds played.
		
There is a chance this program may be tempremental. If it is, send me (A Docile Sloth) a PM with how it's screwed up and I'll see if I can fix it.
